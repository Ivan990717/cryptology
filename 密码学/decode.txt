You name them: work, family, health, friends, and spirit, and you're keeping all of these in the air. You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back. But the other four balls--family, health, friends, and spirit are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged, or even shattered. They will never be the same. You must understand that and strive for balance in your life.What is Love? The eternal question we all carry around deep within our heart. Love is the eternal search. Love is eternal when we find it. But do we really ever find it ? When we define it do we negate it? When we set limits on what we believe to be love do we begin to destroy it by hoping to understand or own it for ourselves? We offer it through all of our relationship we vary our giving, often by what we hope to receive in return. But is this really love?I recently overheard someone say in a conversation that there is no such thing as “ unconditional love .” I would have to agree, although for different reasons. Love within itself is unconditional. Anything else is only an attempt to love, a learning to get us nearer to the one true knowing of love. It may be honorable, well-intentioned, passionate and desiring, courageous and pure. It may be felt as temporary, but if lost easily it may not have been love at all. Love cannot be thwarted and often fall short of what we hope love will be. This is where we learn we are human.today, you see that i am still in this company, which is because i once met a wise man, who told me a workplace truth at my most hesitant time, in the workplace, i want to turn myself into water and be put into any container. this is a friend of mine, a qiang, who works in a famous company. he has a master s degree and his talent in mold design ability. but he can t get the promotion and reuse of the company leader. because he is only focused on technology and does not take time to engage in relationships. finally, in charge of the intolerable supervisor when could not play fast and loose, jiagongjisi, he decided to resign. when he submitted his letter of resignation, he met a manager of a neighbouring department at the staircase, because there were only a few sides with him. the two people smiled and greeted each other. the manager saw a strong hand on the letter of resignation, a look of surprise, he said: if you have another job, congratulations to you. if you are in charge of your department, you have to think about it: you must learn how to get along with different people, otherwise you will always meet such a person, and then lose your mind. this is not too familiar with the manager s words, all of a sudden when it comes to the tip. a lot of people in the workplace angrily stumbled does not understand the problem, the original only in this short a few words. john was shocked. after that, he ripped the letter back to the post, practicing how to get along with hate charge, although he still does not agree with some things against his principles, but he began to seriously, try to look on the bright side of things, and thus also changed from confrontation between supervisor and. a year later, because of a strong business is outstanding, company to set up a branch, and served as a responsible person. he often meet that he learned from a few words of the manager, the manager still has a cool look. although a strong never asked him to say thank you, but he will always remember the day when i met, the wise man in the staircase, a few words of light, open a frozen and full of corners of the original stone heart. we should learn to thank others for laziness, because it is their laziness that enables us to have more opportunities to do things, and set up the stage for us to show their talents and the way to success. i graduated from college to be a clerk in an office of a group company. the director of the office has a special skill, that is, the article is well written and thoughtful. the chairman of the board attached much importance to him. the chairman s speech and the year-end summary of the company were all written by him. i got to the office, only a handyman, dirty, dirty work, did not name the live all i do. after i arrived, the director became more and more lazy, and some of the work that he had to do by himself was often pushed to me. because of the great reputation of the enterprises, enterprises often have to participate in such activities as long run, mountaineering and performance organized by provinces and cities, and should be interviewed and photographed on the spot. for a long time and not working overtime, the director arranged for me to go. company meetings often make use of their spare time in the evening, and the chairman of the meeting often forgets the time and goes to the early hours of the morning. and the meeting needs to be recorded and recorded. the director always lets me go so hard. as a result, i have a lot of night time to attend the meeting, second days to sort out the records, write reports, a lot of work. some of our new students together, often scolded those old comrades, how lazy and diao, exploitation of our work, take our time, the wisdom and the fruits of our labor for himself, so indignant, but some people still do. a reporter from a provincial television station to interview the chairman of the chairman, the chairman of the time is relatively tight, so arranged at 8 o clock on sunday evening. the chairman is accompanied by the director. but the director s home is far away from the company. it takes 40 minutes to ride a bike. so he asked to accompany him. i heard on the air, usually at night to work overtime, i have full stomach, sunday also let me, too that. and what s more, the chairman of the board is for him to attend, and i have an appointment with my girlfriend. i wanted to top him, but later i was reluctant to take part in it. in the interview with tv reporters on that day, chairman of the board was in good spirits, and there were several sparks. that is, the development of the enterprise has been ten years now. it needs ten years to go to zero for second times, and is ready to make a big move in 10th anniversary daqing. the interview was only half an hour, but as the chairman and the reporters talked very much about them, they talked for more than two hours and then went to tea together. when everything is over, it s one o clock in the morning. when the rep

Positive Meanings of LoveWe'd like to share some of the positive meanings love has for us. Love means that I know the person I love. I'm aware of the many sides of the other person - not just the beautiful side but also the limitations, inconsistencies and faults. I have an awareness of the other's feelings and thoughts, and I experience something of the core of that person. I can rate social masks and roles and see the other person on a deeper level. Love means that I care about the welfare of the person I love. To the extent that it is genuine, my caring is not possessive, nor does it hold the other person back. On the contrary, my caring frees both of us. If I care about you, I'm concerned about your growth, and I hope you will become  all that you can become. Consequently, I don't put up obstacles to what you do that enhances you as a person, even though it may result in my  discomfort at times. Love means having respect for the dignity of the person I love. If I love you, I can see you as a separate person, with your own values and thoughts and feelings, and I do not insist that you surrender your identity to match an image of what I expect you to be for me. I can allow and encourage you to stand alone and to be who you are, and I avoid treating you as an object or using you primarily to satisfy my own needs. Love means having a responsibility toward the person I love. If I love you, I respond to most of your major needs as a person. This responsibility does not include my doing for you what you are capable of doing for yourself; nor does it mean that I run your life for you. It does mean  acknowledging that what I am and what I do affects you, so that I am directly involved in your happiness and your suffering. A lover does have  the capacity to hurt or ignore the loved one, and in this sense we see that love involves an acceptance of some responsibility for the impact  my way of being has on you. Love means making a commitment to the person I love. This commitment does not mean surrendering our total selves to each other; nor does it imply that the relationship is necessarily permanent. It does involve a willingness to stay with each other in times of pain, struggle, and despair,  as well as in times of calm and enjoyment. Love means trusting the person I love. If I love you, I trust that you will accept my caring and my love and that you won't deliberately hurt me. I trust that you will find me attractive, and that you won't abandon me; I trust the mutual nature of our love. If we trust each other, we are  willing to be open to each other and reveal our true selves. Love can tolerate imperfection. In a love relationship there are times when I am bored, times when I may feel like giving up, times of real strain, and times I feel I can't move forward. Authentic love does not imply enduring happiness. I can stay during rough times, however, because I can remember what we had together in the past, and I can picture what we will have together in our future if we care enough to face our problems d work them through. We agree with the idea that love is a spirit that changes life. Love is a way of life that is creative and that transforms.  However, love is not reserved for a perfect world. Love is meant for our imperfect world where things go wrong. Love is meant to be a spirit that  works in painful situations. Love is meant to bring meaning into life where nonsense appears to rule. In other words, love comes into an   imperfect world to make it possible to live. Love is open. If I love you, I encourage you to reach out and develop other relationships. Although our love for each other and our commitment to each other might prohibit certain actions on our parts, we are not totally and exclusively married to each other. It is a false love that cements one person to another in such a way that he or she is not given room to grow. Love is selfish. I can only love you if I genuinely love, value, appreciate, and respect myself. If I am empty, then all I can give you is my emptiness. If I feel that I'm complete and worthwhile in myself, then I'm able to give to you out of my fullness. One of the best ways for me to give you love is by fully enjoying myself with you. Love involves seeing the potential within the person we love. In my love for another, I view her or him as the person she or he can become, while still accepting who and what the person is now. By taking people as they are, we make them worse, but by treating them as if they already were what they ought to be, we help make them better. To sum it up, mature love is union under the condition of preserving one's individuality. In love, two beings become one and yet remain two. We should learn to thank others for laziness, because it is their laziness that enables us to have more opportunities to do things, and set up the stage for us to show their talents and the way to success.　　I graduated from college to be a clerk in an office of a group company. The director of the office has a special skill, that is, the article is well written and thoughtful. The chairman of the board attached much importance to him. The chairman's speech and the year-end summary of the  company were all written by him.　　I got to the office, only a handyman, dirty, dirty work, did not name the live all I do. After I arrived, the director became more and more lazy, and some of the work that he had to do by himself was often pushed to me.　　Because of the great reputation of the enterprises, enterprises often have to participate in such activities as long run, mountaineering and performance organized by provinces and cities, and should be interviewed and photographed on the spot. For a long time and not working overtime, the director arranged for me to go.　　Company meetings often make use of their spare time in the evening, and the chairman of the meeting often forgets the time and goes to the early hours of the morning. And the meeting needs to be recorded and recorded. The director always lets me go so hard. As a result, I have a lot of night time to attend the meeting, second days to sort out the records, write reports, a lot of work.　　Some of our new students together, often scolded those old comrades, how lazy and Diao, exploitation of our work, take our time, the wisdom and the fruits of our labor for himself, so indignant, but some people still do.　　A reporter from a provincial television station to interview the chairman of the chairman, the chairman of the time is relatively tight, so arranged at 8 o'clock on Sunday evening.　　The chairman is accompanied by the director. But the director's home is far away from the company. It takes 40 minutes to ride a bike. So he asked me to accompany him. I heard on the air, usually at night to work overtime, I have full stomach, Sunday also let me, too that. And what's more, the chairman of the board is for him to attend, and I have an appointment with my girlfriend. I wanted to top him, but later I was reluctant to take part in it.　　In the interview with TV reporters on that day, chairman of the board was in good spirits, and there were several sparks. That is, the development of the enterprise has been ten years now. It needs ten years to go to zero for second times, and is ready to make a big move in 10th anniversary Daqing.　　The interview was only half an hour, but as the chairman and the reporters talked very much about them, they talked for more than two hours and then went to tea together. When everything is over, it's one o'clock in the morning. When the reporter sent, I have been very tired, not wash sleep.　　On the second day, I arranged the interview summary and gave it to the chairman. Then write a business newspaper published the article, the title of the article is "ten years of zero is from" - Chairman issued second entrepreneurial mobilization. The chairman felt that I was very keen to capture his inspiration, and the emphasis of the article was new and the theme was novel. The chairman was very happy. By the way, why didn't the director come last night. I said, "his home is far away." The chairman then said, "to thank the lazy people around you, to create more opportunities for yourself!"　　Since then, the chairman has often asked me to go to the office, and some of his thoughts and feelings have made me clear. The final report of the end of the year is also let me write. My salary doubled. I became the red man of the company, and I got more and more exercise.　　Most of the time, there are a lot of people don't want to do extra work in front of us, we are often not actively accept and try to do a good job, but the fear of difficulty, managed to escape, always indulge in complain and complain, in a negative, pessimistic attitude or passive waiting, watching. If you have more work to do from another point of view, it should be a very lucky thing. Because, by doing more work, you can improve your ability, increase the experience of the world, and improve the quality of your work. So, when the extra work comes in front of us,  we should cherish this rare opportunity, hold it tightly, and don't let it slip away in vain.　　The pie in the sky, there is always a reason for it to fall out of thin air. Therefore, we must learn to thank others for laziness, because it is their laziness that enables us to have more opportunities to do things, and set up the stage for us to show their talents and the way to success.Diary One I am very lucky to be admitted to the class of Louis. Although it is a optional course ,I am expecting highly of it. I hope that I can get something useful about BEC through this course ,what is more ,laying a foundation for my further study on BEC. That is why I choose it. The first lesson is coming. Louis is really a person who are good activating every one of us. He let us speak out ,speak loudly ,which is contributing to our pour English. I think this is important to English learner .If you wants to learn English well, vocabulary and words are not far  sufficient . In addition to those ,you must have bravery to speak out in public. you must speak out what you want to say to the various  people that include your classmates ,your roommates, your teachers, your friends, and the foreigners .I have studied English for 9 years , but I find I have difficulties in communicating with the other person .Maybe you can think what a bad think .It is shame to say this .  Louis is a enthusiastic man .you can prove it when he introduced himself .it was very unforgettable for us .Because it was very impressing .  Then he let us introduce ourselves. I saw someone stand to introduce himself. Honestly speaking ,I was jealous of them .Because they had the  bravery of which I just be lack. Many times I was intending to stand up to ask questions and answer to him ,but I was finally drawing my hand  back .May be I must have a look at myself. I think I must ask myself these questions: Why I afraid? Why I not stand? Why I not ask? Why I not   put up my hands? Why I not answer the questions? I finally know life is short and time is swift. IF you miss the opportunities, the    opportunities will miss you.. Opportunity waits no man .I think this is what I get from the first class. I know everyone must have a control    of the opportunities which are laid in front of him . I am very appreciating this chance that I can study business English. So I put my heart    into it .I think I will get a lot of things and make many friends in the class. But I remember the old saying: If you want get ,you must give    first .I will never forget this saying .I will give my enthusiasm, my energy, my attention , and my time into it . every one will see it .    When Louis saied it was time for class.. I found time is swift. It could prove that I was very concentrating on the class. The first lesson    is always unforgettable. Because it means that there is a new thing waiting for you . I like challenge ,so I like new things. I think today    is a new day for me .Tomorrow is also new day for me .The day after tomorrow is also new. As for me ,every day is new day for me .Because I    always remember one thing : let bygones be bygones. This is my first business English lesson. I like it Diary Two I think I have a good     night today. I saw Louis again this evening. Because it was time for business English class. I dare to say you can see a smile in his face     everyday . I can guess if somebody is in a bad mood ,he will get better when he sees Louis. According to the thirteen week’ study ,I have     found Louis is a vigorous man. He is full of enthusiasm, and have a lot of energies which seem that they are not used out. Tonight Louis     gave out some paper which was cut to pieces. These pieces came from a business letter. Louis had disorder these piece. Why he did that?     What did he want us to do? A terriblely unsafe idea striked me. I could say for that moment I was in completely confusion. What was the     next step? Louis then saied that it was a business letter which you must put them in right order with the other your group members. I had     got it, but I found there was a bit difficulties for me . On taking the pieces of the letter ,all the group were busy in putting them in     right place.. I thought It was a big pity that my group first came into a big problems. We could not decide which sentence was the fires one.     What was a shame thing. When my group could not decide what to do ,I saw the other group seemed it was ready .I stood up and looked around.      To my disappointment, they were also in confusion. It was very bad time for every of us. Louis stood in the front of the classroom. He seemed      very happy to see that we were in completely confusion. When he came here , had a quick look at our group’ work ,not saying any word and       walking away. Many times I wanted to ask for help ,but I withdrawed my hands. Many times I wanted to give up our pieces ,but I insisted .       After 20 minutes ,Louis told us the right answer. Some sentences we put in right place first ,but some of them were in wrong place finally.        Why? I thought it is confidence that we did not have. In addition , we did not trust our partners. We waste a lot of time in debating ,         which finally proved that it was useless. So I thought this was a helpful game. Every of us could profit a lot from it. I know if one want         to got some achievement ,he must learn how to cooperate with the other people. If he do the big thing alone ,I can guess he will not          success. Today ,the consciousness of the group is more and more important than before. No matter where you go ,no matte what you do ,you          can do without the other people. We must cultivate our consciousness of the group ,and have more and more trust on our partners. IF you           can do this ,I think there is short way between you and success. In addition ,as far as I am concerned we must not give up when the            thing is not ending. There is the saying goes this: the thing will not end until you give it up .I think it is very true. Don’t give             up any thing ,if you can strive for it .Where there is a will ,there is a way ,which mean an long as you possesses a strong will ,             you will certainly accomplish a task no matter how hard it is .In other words, one of words. one of the most important things to              achieve success is a firm resolution. this is the case not only in our studies but also in all walks of life. As for me , I was not              a strong –will person once upon a time .But I now I must change my idea. At the beginning of my college life, I was faced with some               difficulties, including studying and personal sentiment. Once I lost my heart, but I did not give up .I stood up again . With a                firm resolution and after a lot of failure ,I came through these. Diary Three It was a unhappy night. When I heared that we must                write a 2000-word diary about business English class, I found I was in in dizzy. You may don’t know what is the concept of this?                 Since I entered into the fuzhou university ,all the words of English I wrote have not come to this number-2000.It is a terrible                 thing for me .Because I didn’t think I have many things to say .Even so .I didn’t think I can express them by writing.. There                 will be a oral test and paper text waiting for us .I am not good at spoken English . I don’t speak English very well. May be it relates to my diligence .I don't like opening my mouth, speaking English bravely. As a result , I was poor in my spoken English .  The Learning of spoken English likes the learning of swimming. It is obvious that you can never swim if you dare not drop yourself into water.  Swimming can only be learned through practice in water, which can make you get the feeling of water and make your motion correct and effective.   Spoken English also likes this. You can not improve your oral English if you don't communicate wish other people. Only when you speaking English    frequently can you improve your spoken English. Except for the homework and the boring test ,I think I like the business English class in     heart. Louis was good at creating a happy and humorous atmosphere. He was always making the whole class seem interesting. I like this style     of his very much.. Because I didn't fall asleep in class. Maybe it can say that it is a miracle for me. I have maked some friends with my      classmate of the BEC since I went to the business English class. We have communicated some experiences about studying English since then,      which have done me a great help to me. Throughout 13-week’studying business English ,I can not say that I know business English very well       ,but I dare say this period studying will lay foundation for my further studying about business English. I have learned some business letters ,some business words and some vocabularies which are use frequently in communicating in business. We completed the task that the Louis give together, and pointed out each other’ merits and deflects. We haved learn a lot by this way of improving our English level. We liked this  and insisted in doing this. Maybe it also gave us a lot of funny. Once upon a time ,I thought ,my spoken English would never improve again. But since these weeks, through reading English article loudly and fluently in business class of Louis, I have found I improve my poor oral  English a little. It was on my tongue when I wanted say something in English . Now it also likes that. But I am more brave than before when  comes to speaking English .I think this is my great attainment from this business class. There are a few points that I want to share with  everyone who likes English and wants to improve it: Don’t be shy to open your mouth; Don’t want to improve your English alone, you must  communicate with others; Don’t only pay attention to the paper test; Practices makes perfect. This is what I want to say .Maybe it will do  you a help in your improvement in your English. Finally ,let me have a hope. I hope that everyone of business English including Louis and  my classmates will be happy everyday. . Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity. But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free. One hundred  years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years  later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro  is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an  appalling condition. In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent   words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.    This note was a promise that all men would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious    today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred     obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check which has come back marked "insufficient funds." But we refuse to believe that     the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation.      So we have come to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have       also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off       or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit       path of racial justice. Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God's children. Now is the time to lift our nation       from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of       the moment and to underestimate the determination of the Negro. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not       pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who       hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as       usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt       will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. But there is something that I must say       to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we       must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.       We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. we must not allow our creative protest to        degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.         The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to distrust of all white people, for many of our         white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny and their         freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead.          We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, "When will you be satisfied?" we can never be           satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels           of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never           be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no,           we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. I am           not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow cells.           Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds           of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is            redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos             of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. I             say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment, I still have a dream. It is a dream             deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed:              "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal." I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia               the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood. I have     a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be      transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will      not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day the       state of Alabama, whose governor's lips are presently dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, will be transformed        into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls and walk         together as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain         shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall          be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. This is our hope. This is the faith with which I return to the South. With this faith          we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling          discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together,          to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day. This will be           the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, "My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee           I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.And if America is to be            a great nation, this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the             mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania! Let freedom ring from the              snowcapped Rockies of Colorado! Let freedom ring from the curvaceous peaks of California! But not only that; let freedom ring from              Stone Mountain of Georgia! Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee! Let freedom ring from every hill and every molehill               of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring. When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and                every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white                men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, "                Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!
